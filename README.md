# patterndetection

This project consists on a technical study on the Stellarator TJ-II, an experimental device allowing to carry out experiments of turbulent plasmas at high temperature confined by magnetic fields. More precisely, an algorithm for the automatic detection of patterns in the time series of the electrostatic potential measured in the plasma was constructed. For this purpose, a probabilistic model was designed to simulate additional data to those provided and to train a neural network. These patterns correspond to specific events within the reactor: the "Zonal Flows"; this detection is relevant insofar as the understanding and detection of these hazards allows the improvement of the magnetic confinement of the plasma.

For achieving the purpose of the project, the code has been divided in several parts.
